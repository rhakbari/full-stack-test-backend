# Full Stack Test - Backend using GoLang

- I have used Gin Framework to make REST APIs as required in the provided requirement document. 

- I have provided a .env for the environment variables for Database configuration and backend port.

- When the database is connected the tables will be created automatically via models.

- The data from the CSV will be copied into the database tables from the script in the query directory.

- Currently the backend is running on localhost:8000

- Run the below command in your terminal to get started:

```
go run main.go
```
